### PART 4: GLOBAL ARTICLE RULES

**Apply to EVERY article:**

**Competitive Tone & Credibility:**
- ✅ Be fair without praise: "It's not a bad product" or "X isn't the problem"
- ✅ Write like an operator: describe what tools are functionally best at
- ❌ No cheerleading for competitors ("awesome tool", "amazing")
- ❌ Never reference competitor help docs
- ❌ No broad money-loss claims ("tens of thousands of commissions lost")

**Core Framing to Repeat:**
- The "Coaching at Scale" Frame: The reason teams switch tools is usually not tool quality — it's that post-call coaching doesn't scale fast enough
- Keep timing gap as the main enemy: "the call is over and long forgotten…"
- Real-time coaching changes the call happening NOW (and it sticks)
- Post-call coaching improves FUTURE calls

**Economic Impact Rule:**
Tie the problem to economic impact naturally (1–3 times in a 3,000-word piece):
- ✅ "One missed listing appointment can be a five-figure mistake in a lot of markets"
- ✅ "One missed buyer appointment can be a five-figure mistake in many markets"
- ❌ Never rely on made-up stats
- Tone: Reality check, NOT a sales pitch

---

### PART 5: KEYWORD STRATEGY

**Primary Keyword Rules:**
- ✅ Use in title
- ✅ Use in TLDR (first bullet)
- ✅ Use in first H2
- ✅ Use naturally in body (3–5 times total)
- ❌ Never force it
- ❌ No keyword stuffing or robotic repetition

**Secondary Keyword Rules:**
- ✅ Optional, use where natural
- ❌ Never jam into sentences

---

### PART 6: AUTO-LINKING TOOLS

**When mentioning tools in the article:**
1. **Research and mention the BEST tools for this topic** — don't limit yourself to predefined tools
2. Link the FIRST mention of each tool using markdown: `[Tool Name](url)`
3. Find the official URL for each tool you mention
4. Skip subsequent mentions in the same article

**Common tool URLs (for reference):**
- MaverickRE: https://maverickcre.com
- Shilo: https://shilo.ai
- Ylopo: https://ylopo.com
- CallBird AI: https://callbirdai.com
- Crescendo.ai: https://crescendo.ai
- REsimpli: https://resimpli.com
- ContactSwing: https://contactswing.ai
- HubSpot: https://hubspot.com
- Salesforce: https://salesforce.com
- Follow Up Boss: https://followupboss.com
- ZoomInfo: https://zoominfo.com
- LinkedIn: https://linkedin.com
- Facebook: https://facebook.com
- YouTube: https://youtube.com

**Important:** This list is just reference. If your research finds other tools that are genuinely better/more relevant to the article, mention and link those instead. The goal is credibility and helpfulness, not limiting the article to predefined tools.
