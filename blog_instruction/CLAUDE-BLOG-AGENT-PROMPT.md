## PART 4: GLOBAL ARTICLE RULES (Apply to EVERY article)

### A) Competitive Tone & Credibility
- ✅ Be fair without praise: "It's not a bad product" or "X isn't the problem"
- ✅ Write like an operator: describe what tools are functionally best at
- ❌ No cheerleading for competitors ("awesome tool", "amazing")
- ❌ Never reference competitor help docs
- ❌ No broad money-loss claims ("tens of thousands of commissions lost")

### B) Core Framing to Repeat
**The "Coaching at Scale" Frame:**
- The reason teams switch tools is usually not tool quality
- It's that post-call coaching doesn't scale fast enough across a growing team
- Keep the timing gap as the main enemy
- Reinforce: "the call is over and long forgotten…"

**The Core Contrast:**
- Post-call coaching improves future calls
- Real-time coaching changes the call happening now (and it sticks)

**On Gamification/Scoring:**
- Not "gamification is bad"
- The tradeoff: it requires adoption + manager time + repetition over weeks
- Works well with structure, struggles when you need immediate execution lift

**On Roleplay/Training:**
- Treat AI roleplay as reps and practice
- Don't imply it rescues the real prospect call in the moment

### C) Economic Impact Rule
Tie the problem to economic impact when it fits naturally (1–3 times in a 3,000-word piece):
- ✅ "One missed listing appointment can be a five-figure mistake in a lot of markets"
- ✅ "One missed buyer appointment can be a five-figure mistake in many markets"
- ❌ Never rely on made-up stats
- Tone: Reality check, NOT a sales pitch

---

## PART 5: KEYWORD STRATEGY

### Primary Keyword Rules
- ✅ Use in title
- ✅ Use in TLDR (first bullet)
- ✅ Use in first H2
- ✅ Use naturally in body (3–5 times total)
- ❌ Never force it
- ❌ No keyword stuffing or robotic repetition

### Secondary Keyword Rules
- ✅ Optional, use where natural
- ❌ Never jam into sentences
- ❌ Avoid over-optimization

### Forbidden SEO Behaviors
- ❌ Keyword stuffing
- ❌ Over-optimized intros
- ❌ Robotic repetition

---

## PART 6: AUTO-LINKING RULES

### How to Link Tools
1. Load the Tool Link Registry (in `blog_instruction/Tool-Link-Registry.json`)
2. Search the article for tool name matches (case-insensitive)
3. For the FIRST mention of each tool:
   - Wrap it in markdown: `[Tool Name](url)`
   - Use exact URL from registry
4. Skip subsequent mentions in the same article
5. Check aliases list (e.g., "Shilo" vs "Shilo.ai")

### Example
First mention: `[MaverickRE](https://maverickcre.com) is an AI call assistant...`
Later mention: `MaverickRE also integrates with...` (no link)
