Global Article Rules - Applies to every section, every article
A) Competitive tone and credibility
No cheerleading for competitors
Don’t write “awesome tool,” “amazing,” etc.
Be fair without praise: “It’s not a bad product” or “X isn’t the problem.”
Never reference competitor help docs or “their site says”
Avoid any phrasing that signals we learned the product from documentation.
Write like an operator: describe what the tool is functionally best at (category outcomes), not what their docs claim.
No broad money-loss claims
Avoid sweeping statements like “tens of thousands of commissions were lost.”
If money impact is mentioned, it must be scenario-based or market-general without inflated specificity.
B) Core framing to repeat across the article
Use the “coaching at scale” frame as the root cause
The reason teams switch is usually not tool quality. It’s that post-call coaching doesn’t scale fast enough across a growing team.
Keep the timing gap as the main enemy
Reinforce: “the call is over and long forgotten…” when it fits.
The core contrast must stay clean:
Post-call coaching improves future calls
Real-time coaching changes the call happening now. And because the agent gets the guidance in the moment, it sticks and shows up on future calls too.
When you mention gamification or scoring, tie it to the operational tradeoff
Not “gamification is bad.”
The tradeoff: it requires adoption + manager time + repetition over weeks.
Works well with structure, struggles when you need immediate execution lift.
Roleplay/training is helpful, but not the live fix
Treat AI roleplay as reps and practice.
Do not imply it rescues the real prospect call in the moment.
C) Economic impact rule (new, global)
Tie the problem to economic impact whenever it fits the flow (do not overuse)
Add a grounded money line in natural spots (usually 1 to 3 times in a 3,000 word piece).
Approved examples:
“One missed listing appointment can be a five figure mistake in a lot of markets.”
“One missed buyer appointment can be a five figure mistake in many markets.”
Rule: economic impact should feel like a reality check, not a sales pitch, and should never rely on made-up stats.
