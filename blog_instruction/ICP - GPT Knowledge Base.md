Sayso RE - Ideal Customer Profile

Sayso RE is a real time call guidance and coaching platform built for real estate agents and teams who want to book more qualified buyer and seller appointments from outbound calls by having better conversations.

Sayso will not replace agents or agent prospecting.
Sayso will empower agents in real time to have better conversations and book more appointments

What Sayso RE Is Built to Solve
Most agents do not have a lead problem. They have a conversation execution problem. They talk to enough people, but they do not convert enough of those conversations into qualified, completed appointments.

This breakdown happens during the call. Agents are often overly focused on checking boxes and following a script instead of listening and building context. They ask for appointments before the prospect has a clear understanding of why a meeting is worth their time. Timing is off, key questions are skipped, and conversations stay surface level rather than directional.

Over time, this creates a ‘house of cards’. Agents have hundreds of shallow conversations and still manage to book appointments, which feels productive in the moment. But those appointments are built on weak conviction. The prospect has not internalized the value of meeting. As a result, a large percentage of these appointments never actually happen. What looks like momentum is actually unstable, and the gap between activity and real outcomes keeps growing.

The Core Problem Explained Clearly
Outbound calls are unpredictable by nature. Prospects say things agents do not expect, conversations go off topic, and agents can lose control quickly. When this happens during the call, important questions do not get asked. The conversation loses direction. Agents freeze when a prospect says something emotional or unexpected. Silence gets filled with rambling, and agents talk more than they need to listen.

Most coaching does not fix this. Feedback is given well after the moments have passed. Sayso exists to support agents during the call, when outcomes are still controllable.

Why This Problem Is Expensive
This problem is easy to miss because activity looks like progress. Agents stay busy, make calls, and book some appointments, which creates the sense that things are working, but when you look closer, the results do not hold up. A large share of booked appointments do not happen. Conversations feel inconsistent from call to call. Outcomes depend more on how the prospect shows up than on how the agent runs the conversation.

This creates false confidence. Agents believe they are close to a breakthrough when, in reality, the same execution issues keep repeating. Time and energy are spent without producing reliable results, and growth stalls even though effort stays high.

Over time, this becomes expensive. Hours are spent on conversations that never turn into real meetings. Calendars fill with appointments that fall apart. Follow up drags on longer than it should. Agents stay busy without building momentum, and leaders struggle to separate effort from effectiveness. The cost is not just lost deals. It is slower growth, inconsistent income, and a constant feeling of starting over each week.
