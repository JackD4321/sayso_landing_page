## What Is Real-Time Call Coaching?

Real-time call coaching is exactly what it sounds like: AI-powered guidance delivered to sales agents **during** their live calls, not after. Think of it as having your best sales manager whispering the perfect response in your agent's ear — for every single call.

Unlike traditional call recording and post-call analytics (which help you improve *future* calls), real-time coaching improves the call that's happening **right now**.

## How It Works

Modern AI call coaching platforms like Sayso work in three layers:

### Layer 1: Speech Recognition

The AI listens to both sides of the conversation in real time, converting speech to text with high accuracy. This happens with near-zero latency — the system understands what was said almost instantly.

### Layer 2: Intent Analysis

The AI doesn't just transcribe — it **understands**. It identifies:

- What the prospect is really asking
- Which objection category they're raising
- Their emotional tone and engagement level
- Where they are in the decision-making process

### Layer 3: Response Generation

Based on the analysis, the AI surfaces the right response, script, or talking point on the agent's screen. This could be:

- A specific objection handler
- A relevant data point about the prospect's market
- A question to deepen the conversation
- A closing technique appropriate for the moment

## Why Post-Call Analysis Isn't Enough

Post-call analysis has been the industry standard for years. And it's valuable — but it has a fundamental limitation: **it can't help the call that just happened.**

Consider this scenario: Your agent gets the objection "I'm already working with an agent." They fumble the response, the prospect hangs up, and the opportunity is gone. In post-call review, you identify what they *should* have said. Great — but that prospect is gone forever.

With real-time coaching, the moment that objection is raised, the agent sees the recommended response on their screen. The save rate on these moments is dramatically higher.

## The Metrics That Matter

Teams using real-time AI coaching typically see improvements across several key metrics:

| Metric | Before AI Coaching | After AI Coaching | Change |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Appointment Set Rate | 2-3% | 5-7% | +150% |
| Average Call Duration | 1.5 min | 3.2 min | +113% |
| Objection Recovery Rate | 15% | 45% | +200% |
| Agent Confidence Score | 5.2/10 | 8.1/10 | +56% |
| Ramp Time for New Agents | 8 weeks | 3 weeks | -63% |

## Common Objections to AI Coaching

### "Won't it make agents sound robotic?"

No. The best AI coaching tools provide suggestions, not scripts. Agents use their own voice and personality — the AI just ensures they have the right information at the right time.

### "Is it hard to implement?"

Modern solutions integrate with existing dialers and CRMs. Most teams are up and running within a day, not weeks.

### "What about privacy and compliance?"

Reputable AI coaching platforms are built with compliance in mind. They follow all relevant regulations around call recording and data handling.

## Who Benefits Most?

Real-time AI coaching delivers the biggest ROI for:

1. **New agents** — Dramatically reduces ramp time. Instead of 8 weeks to competency, new agents perform at a high level within days.
2. **High-volume teams** — When you're making hundreds of calls per day, even small improvements in set rate translate to massive pipeline gains.
3. **Teams with diverse lead sources** — Different lead types require different approaches. AI adapts in real time.
