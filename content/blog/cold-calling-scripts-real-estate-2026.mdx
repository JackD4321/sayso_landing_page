## Why Your Old Scripts Aren't Working

The real estate market in 2026 is fundamentally different from even two years ago. Prospects are more informed, more guarded, and have less patience for robotic sales pitches. If your team is still using the same scripts from 2023, you're leaving appointments on the table.

The best scripts today don't sound like scripts at all. They sound like conversations.

## Script 1: The Expired Listing Opener

This script works because it leads with empathy, not a pitch.

**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. I noticed your home on [Street] was on the market for a while — I'm sure that was frustrating. I'm not calling to list your home today. I just wanted to share what we're seeing work for other homeowners in [Neighborhood] who were in a similar situation. Would that be helpful?"

**Why it works:** You immediately disarm the prospect by saying you're NOT calling to list their home. This lowers their guard and opens the door to a real conversation.

## Script 2: The FSBO Value Add

**You:** "Hi [Name], I see you're selling your home on [Street] — it looks like a great property. I work with a lot of buyers actively looking in [Neighborhood]. I'm curious — would you be open to a buyer's agent bringing you a qualified buyer, even if you're selling on your own?"

**Why it works:** You're offering value (a qualified buyer) without threatening their decision to sell FSBO.

## Script 3: The Circle Prospecting Script

**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I just helped your neighbor at [Address] sell their home for [price/percentage] over asking. I'm reaching out to a few homeowners in the area because we have buyers who missed out and are looking for a similar home. Have you or any of your neighbors thought about taking advantage of the current market?"

**Why it works:** Social proof from a nearby sale creates urgency and credibility.

## Script 4: The Internet Lead Follow-Up

**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with [Company]. You were looking at homes on [Website] recently — I just wanted to make sure you got the information you needed. Are you still exploring [Area], or has your search changed direction?"

**Why it works:** It's casual, non-pushy, and opens with a question that invites them to share their current situation.

## Script 5: The Referral Ask

**You:** "Hi [Name], I hope you're enjoying the new home! Quick question — do you know anyone in your circle who might be thinking about buying or selling? I'm looking to help a few more families in [Area] this quarter, and I'd love an introduction if anyone comes to mind."

**Why it works:** Past clients are your warmest leads. This script is short, specific, and easy for them to act on.

## Script 6: The Just-Listed Neighbor Call

**You:** "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I just listed a home right near you at [Address] for [Price]. I wanted to give you a heads up since it might affect property values in your area — in a good way! Have you been curious about what your home might be worth in today's market?"

**Why it works:** Curiosity about their own home value is one of the strongest motivators for homeowners.

## Script 7: The AI-Assisted Dynamic Opener

This is where modern tools change the game. Instead of a static script, AI-powered tools like Sayso analyze the prospect's profile and the conversation in real time, feeding your agent the perfect opener and follow-up responses.

**Example flow:**
- AI detects prospect was a past buyer from 5 years ago
- Suggests opener: "Hi [Name], it's been about 5 years since you purchased — a lot has changed in [Area]. Have you thought about how much equity you've built up?"
- When prospect raises an objection, AI provides a tailored response in real time

## Making Scripts Work: The Delivery Factor

Even the best script fails with poor delivery. Three rules:

1. **Slow down** — Nervous agents speak too fast. Match the prospect's pace.
2. **Smile while you dial** — It sounds cliché, but your tone changes when you smile.
3. **Listen more than you talk** — The best calls are 60% listening, 40% talking.
