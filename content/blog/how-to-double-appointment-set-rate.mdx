## The Appointment Setting Problem

Most real estate teams operate with a 2-3% appointment set rate on cold calls. That means for every 100 dials, you're booking just 2-3 appointments. For teams relying on purchased leads, this math simply doesn't work.

But what if you could double — or even triple — that number in just 30 days?

## Why Most Agents Struggle

The biggest issue isn't effort. Your team is making the calls. The problem is **what happens during the call**. Without real-time guidance, agents are left to rely on memory, generic scripts, and gut instinct.

Here's what typically goes wrong:

- **Slow response to objections** — By the time the agent figures out what to say, the prospect has already checked out
- **Generic pitches** — Every call sounds the same, regardless of the lead source or prospect situation
- **No data-driven adjustments** — Teams repeat the same mistakes because there's no feedback loop

## Step 1: Audit Your Current Calls

Before you can improve, you need a baseline. Record and review at least 20 calls from your team. Look for patterns:

1. Where do prospects disengage?
2. Which objections come up most frequently?
3. How long does it take your agents to pivot after an objection?

## Step 2: Implement Real-Time Call Coaching

The single biggest lever you can pull is giving agents **real-time support during calls**. Instead of post-call reviews (which help *future* calls but not the one happening right now), real-time coaching addresses the moment that matters.

Tools like Sayso provide live prompts, objection handlers, and contextual scripts based on what the prospect is actually saying. This turns every call into a coached call.

## Step 3: Build Objection-Specific Playbooks

Generic scripts fail because prospects aren't generic. Build playbooks for your top 10 objections:

- "I'm already working with an agent"
- "I'm not ready to sell yet"
- "Just send me some information"
- "How did you get my number?"
- "I'm on the Do Not Call list"

For each objection, create 2-3 response variations that your team can practice and deploy.

## Step 4: Track and Iterate Weekly

Set up weekly reviews where you look at:

- **Set rate by agent** — Who's improving and who needs extra coaching?
- **Set rate by lead source** — Are some lead types converting better?
- **Set rate by time of day** — When are your best windows?

## The Results

Teams that follow this framework consistently see their appointment set rates jump from 2-3% to 5-7% within 30 days. For a team making 500 dials per week, that's the difference between 10-15 appointments and 25-35 appointments.

That's not incremental improvement — that's a transformed pipeline.
