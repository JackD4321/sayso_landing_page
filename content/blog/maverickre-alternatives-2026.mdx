## MaverickRE Alternatives: 7 Better Options for Real Estate Teams

### TLDR
- MaverickRE works well for brokerages needing a full operations platform, but the cost and learning curve make it overkill for smaller teams
- [Shilo](https://shilo.ai) is better if you only need call coaching and feedback—no fluff, just conversation improvement
- [Ylopo](https://ylopo.com) covers lead generation and AI voice outreach; better if you need both systems integrated
- [CallBird AI](https://callbirdai.com) is the cheapest option at $49/month and handles lead capture and scheduling without bloat
- [Crescendo.ai](https://crescendo.ai) is flexible—works as a chatbot, voice assistant, or email responder depending on your workflow
- [REsimpli](https://resimpli.com) is built specifically for investors and offers specialized call scoring and follow-up automation
- Some teams switch because MaverickRE forces you into their way of working; others find cheaper, more focused alternatives work better

## Why Teams Leave MaverickRE

The truth about MaverickRE is that it's trying to solve too many problems at once. For large brokerages with dozens of agents and complex pipelines, that's valuable. You get lead management, call grading, performance tracking, and training tools all in one place.

But most teams don't need all of that. They just need better conversations on the phone.

When you're a solo agent or running a smaller team, MaverickRE's cost starts to feel expensive relative to what you actually use. You're paying for lead management and advanced reporting features that sit unused while you're really just trying to get better feedback on your calls. The platform has a learning curve too—it takes time to set up properly, and if you're not using the full suite, that investment doesn't pay off.

Other teams switch because they already have a CRM they like. MaverickRE does its job, but you're essentially maintaining two systems that don't talk to each other as cleanly as they should.

And then there are the teams that just want a more direct tool. MaverickRE's structure works, but it forces you into a specific workflow. Some teams find that limiting. They'd rather pick and choose—get the conversation coaching they need, keep their existing CRM, and skip the rest.

## What to Look for in a Replacement

When you're evaluating alternatives, you need to be clear about what problem you're actually trying to solve.

Are you looking to improve how your agents talk on the phone? Then call coaching and feedback is your focus.

Are you trying to handle more incoming leads without hiring more people? Then you need something that answers calls and qualifies leads on your behalf.

Are you trying to generate new leads with AI outreach? That's a different tool entirely—more about automation and volume than coaching.

The mistake most teams make is looking for one tool that does everything. That's why they stick with MaverickRE even though it's expensive. But really, you should start with the one problem that's costing you the most money right now, then build from there.

## 7 MaverickRE Alternatives Worth Considering

### 1. Shilo — Best if You Only Care About Better Conversations

[Shilo](https://shilo.ai) is the most direct competitor to MaverickRE's call coaching features. It listens to your agent's calls and grades them on conversation quality—same idea, different execution.

**What it does:** Transcribes calls, scores agent performance on specific metrics (talk-to-listen ratio, objection handling, question frequency), and lets agents roleplay previous calls with AI feedback.

**Strengths:**
- Cheaper than MaverickRE if you just want the coaching part
- Focused and simple—no extra features to confuse things
- Good at identifying specific conversation problems (agents talking too much, not asking enough questions)
- Works with your existing CRM

**Limits:**
- No lead management—you're not generating or tracking leads here
- No automation—you're not delegating outbound calls to AI
- If you need a full platform, this is only one piece

**Best for:** Agents and smaller teams that already have a solid lead flow but want to improve conversion rates through better calling skills.

---

### 2. Ylopo — Best if You Need Lead Generation + AI Voice

[Ylopo](https://ylopo.com) is less of a call coaching tool and more of a lead generation platform that happens to include AI voice calling.

**What it does:** Generates leads through digital marketing, then uses AI to make outbound calls on your behalf with an AI voice that sounds almost human. Also handles text follow-up and scheduling.

**Strengths:**
- Brings leads and the ability to work those leads automatically—you get both
- AI voice calling happens 24/7 without agent involvement
- Text follow-up is integrated—no jumping between tools
- Better suited to teams that need volume and automation, not just coaching

**Limits:**
- More expensive than pure coaching tools because you're paying for lead generation
- AI voice calling, while effective, won't replace live agents for complex conversations
- Takes time to see ROI because lead generation ramps up gradually

**Best for:** Teams with the budget to invest in lead generation and automation together. If you already have leads, Ylopo is overkill.

---

### 3. CallBird AI — Best Budget Option

[CallBird AI](https://callbirdai.com) is the cheapest option on this list at $49/month, and it's honest about what it does.

**What it does:** AI receptionist that answers incoming calls, qualifies the caller (budget, timeline, property interest), and schedules appointments directly into your calendar.

**Strengths:**
- Incredibly affordable—won't blow your budget
- Handles inbound leads automatically so your agents focus on follow-up
- Syncs with Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, and other CRMs
- Setup is straightforward; no complex configuration

**Limits:**
- This is call answering, not call coaching—it's not helping your agents get better
- Doesn't handle outbound calling or lead generation
- Limited to just appointment scheduling; no deeper lead qualification

**Best for:** Solo agents or small teams getting inbound leads that need a simple way to answer calls and schedule showings without hiring staff.

---

### 4. Crescendo.ai — Most Flexible for Different Workflows

[Crescendo.ai](https://crescendo.ai) isn't a pure call coaching tool. It's more like a Swiss Army knife for customer communication.

**What it does:** Provides AI assistance via live chat, email, SMS, and phone. Works on your website to answer buyer and seller questions 24/7, handles routine inquiries about listings, mortgages, and property details.

**Strengths:**
- Works across multiple channels—buyers reach you however they prefer
- Handles the repetitive questions so your agents don't have to
- Scales with your website traffic; doesn't require per-agent licensing
- Can handle 24/7 lead engagement without staff

**Limits:**
- Not designed for real-time coaching during agent calls
- Better for lead capture and nurture than for improving agent performance
- More of a chatbot than a conversation coach

**Best for:** Teams that want to capture and nurture more website leads without adding headcount. Good if your team is strong on calls but weak on initial response time.

---

### 5. REsimpli — Best if You're an Investor

[REsimpli](https://resimpli.com) is built specifically for real estate investors, not traditional agents. But it's worth mentioning because it has solid call coaching features.

**What it does:** AI CRM designed for investor workflows. Includes VoiceFollow for automatic phone follow-ups, CallAnswer for inbound call capture, and CallGrade for analyzing and scoring agent performance.

**Strengths:**
- Purpose-built for investor workflows; other tools feel generic
- Call scoring and feedback are solid
- Automatic follow-up sequences save manager time
- Good for teams managing high call volume

**Limits:**
- Overkill if you're a traditional agent focused on residential sales
- Designed for a specific workflow; less flexible if you work differently
- Another full platform when you might just need coaching

**Best for:** Real estate investors and investment-focused teams. If you're selling buyer/seller transactions, this is designed for someone else.

---

### 6. ContactSwing — Best for Simple Lead Qualification

[ContactSwing](https://contactswing.ai) is straightforward: it's an AI that handles initial lead qualification and appointment scheduling.

**What it does:** Receives inbound inquiries, qualifies intent and budget, validates contact info, and books meetings on your calendar automatically.

**Strengths:**
- Handles the first conversation so your agents focus on the important ones
- Works across multiple channels (web, chat, phone, email)
- Simple setup with no complicated integrations required
- Good at filtering out tire-kickers early

**Limits:**
- Again, this is lead capture, not agent coaching
- Doesn't improve how your agents perform on calls
- No advanced analytics or performance tracking

**Best for:** Teams with steady inbound lead flow that need to triage faster. If your problem is conversion rate on live calls, this won't help.

---

### 7. Sentient — Best for Deep Call Analysis

[Sentient](https://sentient.ai) (formerly known as some AI call platforms) focuses on deep transcription and call analysis beyond simple grading.

**What it does:** Records and transcribes calls, then uses AI to identify patterns across your entire team—what questions high performers ask, when deals slip away, where objections aren't being handled.

**Strengths:**
- Shows patterns across the entire team, not just individual calls
- Good for identifying specific training gaps
- Works with any CRM or dialer
- Less prescriptive—gives you the data and lets you decide what to do with it

**Limits:**
- More analytical than coaching—you get insights, not step-by-step guidance
- Requires some interpretation; it's not as directive as MaverickRE
- Pricing varies; not always transparent upfront

**Best for:** Teams that want to understand *why* agents are struggling, not just *that* they're struggling. Works best with coaches or managers who can translate insights into training.

## The Real Talk About Switching

Here's what nobody says: the tool doesn't matter as much as what you actually do with it.

Teams that improve their appointment set rate don't do it because they bought the right software. They improve because they:
- Actually listen to their calls and take the feedback seriously
- Change how they talk based on what they learn
- Repeat that cycle until it sticks

That works with Shilo, Crescendo, CallBird, or even a simple recording tool if you pair it with actual coaching.

The mistake is thinking the problem is the software. Usually, it's that the feedback loop is too slow or too general. You need to hear what went wrong while you still remember the call, when you can actually change it next time. You need specific feedback, not a score.

## What Sayso Brings to This Conversation

Most of the tools above are looking backward—they review a call after it's over. By then, the moment is gone. You can improve next time, but you can't save this call.

[Sayso](https://sayso.ai) works during the call. Real-time prompts help your agent stay on track while the prospect is still talking. That's a different problem to solve than what MaverickRE or Shilo do.

If your issue is agents freezing mid-call, losing the thread, or rambling when they should be listening, real-time guidance can help right then. If your issue is that your team needs consistent coaching structure and detailed performance tracking, you're probably better off with a full platform.

Most teams actually need both—real-time support during the moment and good feedback after. But if you're switching from MaverickRE because it's too expensive or too complex, you might start with a focused tool that solves one problem well, then add real-time coaching later if you need it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the biggest difference between MaverickRE and Shilo?

MaverickRE is a full operations platform with lead management, reporting, and coaching all built in. Shilo is pure call coaching—it listens to calls and provides feedback. If you already have a CRM and just want better call feedback, Shilo is simpler and cheaper. If you need a complete platform, MaverickRE still does that job.

### Can I use one of these tools alongside my existing CRM?

Yes. Most of these tools are designed to work with whatever CRM you already have. They either integrate directly or work independently and sync via API. The big exception is if you're getting a full platform like REsimpli; those expect to be your main system.

### Which tool will actually improve my appointment set rate?

Any of them *could*, but they work differently. If your agents talk too much and don't listen well, call coaching from Shilo or MaverickRE helps. If your problem is that inbound leads don't get handled fast enough, CallBird or Crescendo helps. If you're not even generating enough leads to talk to, Ylopo addresses that. Start by diagnosing which problem is actually costing you money.

### Is real-time coaching better than post-call feedback?

Real-time guidance helps you not lose the sale right now. Post-call feedback helps you not lose the next sale. Ideally you get both, but real-time is more expensive to implement. If your team is relatively stable and coachable, post-call feedback might be enough. If your team is newer or your agents freeze under pressure, real-time support is worth the cost.

### How long does it take to see ROI from switching tools?

If you're switching to fix a real problem (agents not listening, inbound calls getting dropped, no lead qualification), you usually see a difference within 2-4 weeks. If you're switching because you think a new tool will magically fix things, you won't see improvement. The tool is just the mechanism. Your team has to actually use it and take the feedback seriously.

---

## The Bottom Line

MaverickRE works. It's a capable platform. But it's solving more problems than you might actually have.

Start by being honest about what's not working. Are your agents having bad conversations? Get a coaching tool. Are you dropping inbound leads? Get a call answering system. Are you not generating enough leads? Get a lead generation platform.

Trying to solve everything with one expensive tool usually means you're overpaying for features you don't use and underpaying attention to the specific problem that's actually costing you money.

The best tool is the one that addresses your real problem and gets out of your way. Sometimes that's MaverickRE. Sometimes it's something simpler.

If you're looking for something that handles conversation coaching without the overhead, most teams find one of these alternatives worth a closer look. But remember: the tool won't improve your team. Your team has to want to improve, and the tool just has to make it easier.
