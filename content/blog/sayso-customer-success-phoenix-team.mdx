## The Challenge

Marcus Rivera runs a 12-agent team at eXp Realty in Phoenix, Arizona. Like many high-volume real estate teams, they were making hundreds of cold calls per day using Follow Up Boss for their CRM and Mojo Dialer for outbound calling.

The problem? Their appointment set rate had plateaued at 2.1%. Despite investing in training, scripts, and role-playing sessions, they couldn't seem to break through.

"We were doing everything right on paper," Marcus explains. "Our agents were making the calls, following the scripts, doing their role-plays. But when a prospect threw a curveball objection, our agents would freeze up. And by the time we reviewed the call in our weekly meeting, that opportunity was long gone."

## The Turning Point

Marcus discovered Sayso through a colleague at a real estate conference. What caught his attention was the real-time aspect — the idea that his agents could get coaching *during* the call, not just after.

"I'd tried every post-call analytics tool out there. They're great for identifying patterns, but they can't save the call that's happening right now. Sayso was the first tool that addressed the actual moment of truth."

## The Implementation

Getting started was simpler than Marcus expected. Sayso integrated with their existing Follow Up Boss + Mojo Dialer stack within a day. No ripping out existing tools, no complex migration.

The team started with a pilot group of 4 agents for the first week, then rolled out to all 12 agents after seeing early results.

## The Results

After 30 days with Sayso, the numbers told the story:

- **Appointment set rate:** 2.1% → 5.4% (157% increase)
- **Average call duration:** 1.8 min → 3.5 min (prospects staying on longer)
- **Objection recovery rate:** 12% → 48% (agents saving conversations that would have been lost)
- **New agent ramp time:** 6 weeks → 2 weeks

But beyond the numbers, Marcus noticed something unexpected: his agents' confidence skyrocketed.

> "The biggest change wasn't in the metrics — it was in our team's energy. Agents who used to dread cold calling now look forward to it. They know they have backup on every call. That confidence comes through in their voice, and prospects respond to it."

## The Ripple Effect

The improved set rate had cascading effects on the business:

- **More appointments** meant more listing presentations
- **Better call quality** meant higher show rates on booked appointments
- **Increased agent confidence** meant lower turnover
- **Faster onboarding** meant Marcus could scale his team more aggressively

Within 90 days, Marcus's team went from 10-12 appointments per week to 25-30 — without adding a single additional agent or increasing their dial count.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Post-call coaching has limits.** The real leverage is in the live moment.
2. **Integration matters.** Sayso worked with their existing tools, not against them.
3. **Confidence compounds.** When agents feel supported, everything improves.
4. **You don't need more leads.** You need to convert more of the leads you already have.
