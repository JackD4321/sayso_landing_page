## Shilo Alternatives for Real-Time Call Coaching

### TLDR

- Teams searching for Shilo alternatives are usually trying to solve a call execution problem, not just a data problem
- Shilo delivers fast, post-call feedback. If you need guidance during the call itself, that is a different category of tool
- [MaverickRE](https://maverickcre.com) is the strongest alternative if you want a full ops platform built around call performance and pipeline management
- [Sayso](https://sayso.ai) is built for during-call guidance. It prompts agents in the moment, while the conversation is still happening
- [ContactSwing](https://contactswing.ai) automates the calling itself. It replaces human callers rather than coaching them
- The right alternative depends on whether your problem is post-call analysis, during-call execution, or lead handling volume

---

## Introduction

If you are evaluating Shilo alternatives, the first thing worth getting clear on is what you are actually trying to fix.

[Shilo](https://shilo.ai) is a post-call coaching tool. It grades calls, surfaces key moments, and gives agents structured feedback after each conversation. That feedback arrives quickly, often within minutes of a call ending. But it arrives after the call ends. The agent reads it, processes it, and tries to apply it to the next call. That is a useful feedback loop, and for some teams it works well.

The reason teams start looking for alternatives is usually one of two things. Either they want more than call grading, things like pipeline reporting, ISA tracking, or lead routing built into the same platform. Or they want something that works during the call itself, not in the review that comes after.

Those are two different problems. Knowing which one you have makes the search considerably shorter.

---

## Why Teams Start Looking for Shilo Alternatives

Shilo was built with a focused purpose: helping agents have better conversations, one call at a time. That focus is both its strength and its limit.

### The coaching timing gap

The core tension with any post-call tool is timing. A call ends. The agent moves to the next number. The specific moment where they lost control of the conversation is already fading. By the time they read feedback from any post-call platform, the context is partially gone, and the emotional texture of the call is mostly forgotten.

Post-call feedback improves future calls. That is genuine value. But it does not save the call that just ended. For real estate teams where one missed listing appointment can be a five-figure mistake in a lot of markets, that timing gap has a real cost.

This is not unique to Shilo. Any tool that reviews calls after they are over faces the same structural limit. The question is whether post-call improvement is fast enough for what your team needs.

### When agents know the script but still lose control

For teams with experienced agents who just need a consistent feedback loop, fast post-call coaching tends to work. The grading is structured, the feedback is actionable, and the review cycle keeps agents sharp over time.

The problem shows up when agents have the knowledge but fall apart in the live moment. They know what question to ask when a seller objects. They freeze anyway. They know the right framing when a buyer pushes back on price. They stumble through it. Post-call coaching tells them what they should have done. It does not help them in the moment it mattered.

A team with this pattern will often improve slowly with post-call coaching, but not as fast as the appointments they are losing would warrant.

### Pricing and scope

Shilo's pricing is usage-based, starting around $5.80 per call hour for larger teams. For high-volume operations, that can become unpredictable at scale. Teams also find that Shilo's focused scope leaves gaps. There is no pipeline management, no ISA-specific performance reporting, and no lead routing. That is not a flaw in the design. A focused tool should stay focused. But teams that need coaching plus operational visibility often end up stitching multiple tools together to fill those gaps.

### The real-time marketing confusion

One point worth flagging before we get into alternatives: Shilo's marketing describes the product as "real-time AI coaching." Their homepage and partner announcements use that language. But Shilo's actual product workflow, as described in their own help documentation, is a post-call review process. After a call ends, Shilo analyzes the recording and delivers grades, improvement suggestions, and transcripts.

That is fast post-call feedback. It is useful. It is not the same thing as prompts that appear on an agent's screen while the prospect is still talking. This distinction matters when you are comparing options. Tools that deliver guidance during the conversation are a genuinely different category.

---

## What to Look for in a Shilo Alternative

Before picking a replacement, get clear on the problem you are actually trying to solve. Here are the right questions:

**Is your problem that agents do not know what to say?** That is a training problem. Role-play tools, practice scenarios, and structured coaching sessions help. A post-call grading tool accelerates the feedback loop.

**Is your problem that agents know what to say but fall apart during live calls?** That is an execution problem. During-call guidance addresses it directly. Post-call review helps over time but does not fix the moment.

**Is your problem that you lack visibility into team patterns?** That is a data problem. Post-call analytics, manager dashboards, and ISA performance tracking tools address this.

**Is your problem that you do not have enough callers for the lead volume?** That is a capacity problem. AI dialing and automated voice agents address this, though they work by replacing human callers rather than coaching them.

Most tools solve one of these categories well. Pick based on your actual constraint, not the longest feature list.

## Top Shilo Alternatives for Real Estate Teams

### 1. MaverickRE

**Best for:** Teams that want post-call AI grading plus a full operations platform

MaverickRE is the most complete alternative to Shilo if you want to stay in the post-call coaching lane but also need pipeline management, ISA tracking, and team reporting. It is built specifically for real estate teams using Follow Up Boss.

MaverickRE grades 100 percent of calls automatically with real estate-specific criteria, including LPMAMA tracking and objection handling patterns. Beyond call coaching, the platform includes ISA performance tracking, lead routing through their ProDispatch feature, manager dashboards, appointment outcome tracking, and an AI role-play module with over 100 scenarios and thousands of conversation variants.

**What it does well:**

- Real estate-specific call grading that maps to how real estate conversations actually work
- Full sales funnel visibility from lead intake to appointment outcome
- Manager-level reporting across individual agents and the team as a whole
- Built-in AI role-play for training, not just post-call review
- Accountability features: leaderboards, SMS nudges, and automated alerts

**Where it is limited:**

- MaverickRE requires Follow Up Boss for most of its core features. If you use Sierra Interactive, CINC, or a different CRM, the tool's value drops significantly
- It is more expensive and more complex than Shilo. If you only want call coaching and feedback, this is likely more platform than you need
- The learning curve is real. Setting it up properly takes time, and teams that do not use the full suite often feel they are paying for unused features

**Honest take:** MaverickRE is the right choice if you are already inside the Follow Up Boss ecosystem and want coaching, pipeline reporting, and training in one place. If you want to keep your current CRM and just improve how agents execute on calls, MaverickRE is probably more than the problem requires.

### 2. Sayso

**Best for:** Teams where agents freeze or lose control during the live call

Sayso works differently than Shilo and MaverickRE. Instead of reviewing calls after they end, Sayso listens during the call and provides real-time prompts for the next best question or statement, while the prospect is still on the line.

That distinction matters in practice. When an agent is on the phone with a seller who says they are probably not moving until next year, Sayso shows the agent the right response in that moment. Not in a feedback email an hour later. The agent stays directional. The conversation does not drift.

Sayso is built for real estate agents and teams making outbound calls. It does not generate leads, does not replace a CRM, and does not handle scheduling or marketing automation. What it does is help agents stay in control of conversations that go off script, which is most conversations worth having.

**What it does well:**

- During-call prompts that surface the right question or response as the conversation unfolds
- Real estate-specific guidance for the objections and detours that actually come up during seller and buyer calls
- Works alongside your existing CRM and dialer. No ripping out current tools or rebuilding workflows
- Coaching scales without requiring more manager hours per agent. Every call gets support, not just the ones a manager happens to observe

**Where it is limited:**

- Sayso is not a post-call analytics platform. If you need detailed call grading, performance trend reports, or manager dashboards, you would pair Sayso with a separate analytics tool
- It is not a lead source, a CRM, or a scheduling tool. It is a conversation layer. Teams that need broader ops visibility should budget for additional tools

**Honest take:** If post-call coaching has already been part of your workflow for a while and appointment rates have not moved enough, the problem is often earlier in the call than review can reach. Sayso addresses the specific moment the post-call tools miss.

### 3. ContactSwing

**Best for:** Teams that want AI to handle call volume, not coach callers

ContactSwing is a different category of product. It is an AI voice agent that makes and receives calls automatically. It does not coach human agents. It operates in place of them.

For real estate teams with high lead volume and not enough callers to handle the flow, ContactSwing handles outbound prospecting and inbound lead qualification around the clock. It books appointments, qualifies buyers and sellers based on preset criteria, and pushes the outcome data back to your CRM.

**What it does well:**

- Automated outbound and inbound calling without staffing limits or availability gaps
- Lead qualification at volume that does not depend on agent schedules
- Multilingual support
- Accessible pricing that starts at $25 per month, which makes it worth testing for smaller operations

**Where it is limited:**

- This is an automated caller, not a coaching tool. It does not improve how your human agents perform on calls
- For nuanced seller conversations, price negotiations, and emotional situations, AI voice agents still have real limits. Trained human agents handle those conversations better
- If your problem is that human agents are losing appointments they should be booking, ContactSwing does not solve that problem

**Honest take:** ContactSwing is useful for teams trying to handle inbound lead volume without adding headcount, or for running basic outbound prospecting at scale. It is not a Shilo alternative in the coaching sense. It addresses a different operational problem.

### 4. REsimpli

**Best for:** Real estate investors and wholesalers who need call grading within a CRM

REsimpli is built for real estate investors, specifically wholesalers and fix-and-flip operations. It includes an integrated CRM, automated outreach tools, and CallGrade AI, which scores seller calls and evaluates rep performance automatically after each conversation.

If you run a wholesale operation where your team is making outbound calls to distressed sellers, REsimpli provides call coaching functionality inside a CRM that understands your workflow. That is a meaningful difference from patching a separate coaching tool onto a CRM that was not built for your use case.

**What it does well:**

- All-in-one: CRM, call grading, and lead tracking in one platform
- Predictable pricing from $99 to $499 per month depending on tier
- Investor-specific call criteria and follow-up workflows built into the platform
- SpeedToLead AI, which calls new leads immediately when they come in

**Where it is limited:**

- REsimpli is not designed for traditional brokerage teams working buyer and seller leads in the conventional real estate context
- The CRM is built around investor workflows. It does not map cleanly to listing appointments, buyer consultations, or standard brokerage pipelines
- CallGrade AI is a feature of the CRM package, not a standalone tool you can add to your current stack

**Honest take:** REsimpli is worth considering if you run an investor or wholesale operation and want call grading without paying for a separate platform. If you are running a brokerage team making traditional outbound calls on listing and buyer leads, the tool is built for a different use case.

## A Real Scenario Worth Thinking Through

Consider a team running eight agents making outbound calls to seller leads. They are using Shilo and getting structured post-call feedback. Grades are coming in consistently. Agents are reading the feedback.

But the appointment set rate is not moving much. Managers review the calls and notice the same pattern repeatedly: agents start the conversation fine, but when a seller says something off-script, such as "we are thinking about it but not ready yet" or "we had a bad experience with an agent last year," the agents back off. They acknowledge what the seller said, fill the silence with small talk, and lose control of where the call is going.

Post-call coaching tells them: "You should have asked about their timeline" or "That was the moment to address the past experience directly." That feedback is accurate. It does not save the call that just ended.

The problem is not knowledge. The agents know what to do. The problem is execution in the moment when a real conversation goes sideways. That is a different problem than what post-call review is built to solve.

For a team in that situation, the right question is not which post-call tool grades calls better. It is whether you are solving the right part of the problem.

---

## Where Sayso Fits in This Conversation

Most of the tools in this list are looking backward. They review what happened after a call ends. By then, the moment is gone. You can improve the next call, but you cannot save the one that just finished.

Sayso works during the call. Real-time prompts help agents stay on track while the prospect is still talking. That is a different problem to solve than what Shilo or MaverickRE do.

If your issue is agents freezing mid-call, losing the thread, or rambling when they should be listening, during-call guidance addresses that in the moment it matters. If your issue is that your team needs consistent coaching structure, detailed performance tracking, and pipeline visibility across the organization, a full platform is probably the better fit.

The honest answer is that some teams need both: real-time support to fix the execution gap now, and post-call analytics to track improvement over time. Sayso and Shilo can run alongside each other in the same workflow. They address different parts of the same problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Shilo a real-time coaching tool?**

Shilo's marketing uses the phrase real-time AI coaching, but the actual workflow is post-call. After a call ends, Shilo analyzes the recording and delivers feedback, grades, and improvement suggestions. The turnaround is fast, but guidance arrives after the conversation is over, not during it.

**What is the main difference between Shilo and MaverickRE?**

Shilo is focused on conversation coaching through post-call grading and feedback. MaverickRE is a broader platform that includes call grading, ISA tracking, pipeline reporting, lead routing, and role-play training. MaverickRE requires Follow Up Boss for most of its core features. Shilo integrates with several CRMs without locking you into one platform.

**What does a real-time call coaching tool actually do during a call?**

A real-time coaching tool listens to the live conversation and displays prompts on the agent's screen as the call progresses. When the prospect says something that shifts the direction of the call, the tool surfaces the right response in the moment. The agent does not need to improvise or remember every script branch. The guidance appears when it is needed.

**Can a team use Sayso alongside Shilo or another post-call tool?**

Yes. Sayso handles during-call guidance. A post-call tool like Shilo handles post-call review and grading. Some teams use both as part of the same workflow. They address different parts of the same problem: execution in the moment versus pattern improvement over time.

**Which tool is best for a small team of three to five agents?**

For a small team, simpler is usually better. If you want post-call feedback without heavy setup, Shilo is easier to deploy than MaverickRE. If agents are struggling in the live moment rather than needing better review, Sayso is worth considering. ContactSwing and REsimpli serve different use cases and are less likely to be the right fit for a traditional small brokerage team making outbound calls.

---

## Next Steps

If you are looking for a Shilo alternative because post-call coaching has not moved your appointment rate the way you expected, the problem may be earlier in the call than a review process can reach. Getting agents the right response in the moment is a different kind of support than reviewing what they should have said afterward.
