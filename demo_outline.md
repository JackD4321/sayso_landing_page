# Sayso Demo Video — 60-Second Script + Animation Direction

## What All Four Experts Agree On
- **Lead with the feeling, not the feature.**  
  “What if you never froze on a call again?” beats “Scripts don’t work.”

- **Cut content by 40–50%.**  
  Pick **one** information track per frame. Don’t compete with yourself.

- **Show one prompt, make it short.**  
  **8–10 words max.** Readable in **2 seconds.**.

- **State the transformation explicitly.**  
  “More appointments from the same calls” must appear **on screen**.

- **End with a clear CTA.**  
  “Try Sayso free” or “Book your demo.” Make it obvious.

## Recommended Structure
| Beat | Time | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| HOOK | 0–8s | The stuck moment. Visceral recognition: “That’s me.” |
| DREAM | 8–15s | What if it didn’t have to be this way? |
| REVEAL | 15–25s | Introduce Sayso. One sentence. What it does. |
| DEMO | 25–45s | One prompt. Agent uses it. Prospect responds. Simple. |
| PAYOFF | 45–52s | Appointment booked. State transformation explicitly. |
| CTA | 52–60s | Clear action: book demo / try free / download. |

## Final Script (60 Seconds)
Read this aloud with a timer. Target **55–58 seconds** to leave room for visual beats.

---

### Frame 1 — The Stuck Moment (0–8s)
**VISUAL**  
Comic-book style agent at desk. Headset on. Phone ringing. Dynamic panel layout.  
Agent looks **frozen**: sweat drops, question marks above head, action lines showing tension.  
Think: hero in trouble before the power-up.

**ON SCREEN**  
You’re mid-call. They said something important. You have no idea what to say next.

**AUDIO**  
Phone ring SFX. Tense beat. Comic-style “RING!” text effect.

**EMOTION**  
Instant recognition. You’ve been there. Guard drops.

---

### Frame 2 — The Dream (8–15s)
**VISUAL**  
Same agent, now confident posture. Subtle **blue glow** (Sayso energy).  
Thought bubble appears with a lightbulb. Transition: problem → possibility.

**ON SCREEN**  
“What if you always knew exactly what to ask?”

**AUDIO**  
Music shifts hopeful (not cheesy).

**EMOTION**  
Interest. “Go on…”

---

### Frame 3 — The Reveal (15–25s)
**VISUAL**  
Sayso logo appears with a comic reveal: energy burst (yellow rays, blue core).  
Transition to a simplified concept screen: **just a clean prompt box**, not full UI.

**ON SCREEN**  
Meet Sayso. It listens to your calls and shows you what to say next — in real time.

**AUDIO**  
Subtle “power-up” tone (confident, not gamer-y).

**EMOTION**  
Clarity. “Oh, that’s what this does.”

---

### Frame 4 — The Demo (25–45s)
This is the longest frame. Show **one complete interaction**.

**VISUAL**  
Split-panel comic layout:  
- **Left:** Agent with Sayso prompt appearing (blue speech bubble, yellow border).  
- **Right:** Prospect in a relatable setting (car, kitchen, etc.).  
Sayso prompt floats near agent like a sidekick whispering the answer.

**SAYSO PROMPT (8–10 words)**  
“What matters most — more space or closer to work?”

**AGENT SAYS**  
Agent repeats the prompt naturally. Speech bubble mirrors the words.  
Posture: confident, superhero energy.

**PROSPECT REACTS**  
“Honestly? More space. We’re expecting our second.”  
Expression shifts from guarded → engaged. Prospect bubble gets warmer tone.

**ON SCREEN**  
Sayso hears the conversation. Shows you what to ask. You stay in the moment.

**EMOTION**  
Relief. Belief. “This actually works.”

---

### Frame 5 — The Payoff (45–52s)
**VISUAL**  
Success moment: calendar icon + checkmark. Star burst effects.  
Agent in superhero pose (optional subtle cape hint). Big comic “BOOKED!” effect.

**ON SCREEN**  
More appointments. Same calls. No guessing.

**AUDIO**  
Music peaks, satisfying resolve.

**EMOTION**  
Desire. “I want that.”

---

### Frame 6 — The CTA (52–60s)
**VISUAL**  
Clean end card. Sayso logo centered. CTA button below (animated glow).  
Clean gradient background: light blue → cream. Site visible.

**ON SCREEN**  
Try Sayso free. Book your demo.

**AUDIO**  
Music resolves cleanly. Hold end card 2–3 seconds.

**EMOTION**  
Action. Clear next step.

## Animation Direction
**Overall style:** Comic-book superhero aesthetic meets professional B2B.

### Character Design
- Stylized stick-figure agents with personality (simple bodies, expressive poses)
- Minimal facial features (dot eyes, simple mouth); emotion through expression changes (worried → confident)
- Body language sells the transformation (hesitation in Frame 1 vs superhero confidence in Frame 5)
- Reference vibe: XKCD meets The Incredibles, The Oatmeal energy, Invincible-ish pacing

### Color Palette
- **Sayso Blue:** `#0066FF`  
- **Sayso Yellow:** `#FFD700`  
- **Dark Navy:** `#1A1A2E`  
- **Background gradient:** `#E8F4FD` → `#FFF8E7`

**Usage**
- Blue = Sayso UI elements, prompts, power-up effects, confidence energy  
- Yellow = action accents, CTA buttons, success moments  
- Navy = outlines, text, grounding elements  
- Backgrounds = clean, not busy

### Visual Effects
- Comic text effects: “RING!”, “BOOKED!”, “POW!” (impact moments)
- Action lines: speed lines for movement, tension lines for stress, radiating lines for success
- Power-up effects: blue glow when Sayso activates; energy burst on logo reveal
- Star bursts for payoff moment
- Subtle halftone dots (Ben-Day shading) — don’t overdo it
- Speech bubbles: classic comic style  
  - Sayso prompts: blue bubble + yellow border  
  - Prospect dialogue: warmer tone bubble

### Composition
- Panel layouts with bold dividers, dynamic angles
- Frame 4 demo: diagonal split (agent left, prospect right) for energy
- Transitions: comic page turns / panel wipes (avoid standard dissolves)

## What to Avoid
- No realistic phone mockups or UI screenshots
- No literal product interface demonstrations
- No 3D effects that break the cartoon aesthetic
- No dark/gritty comic style — keep it energetic and optimistic
- No overly detailed rendering — simplicity is key
